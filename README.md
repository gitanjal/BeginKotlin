# BeginKotlin
Basic elements of an android project using Kotlin.

BeginKotlin is an extremely simple project to help you start writing kotlin for your android projects. It is a companion project for a 
series of posts on kotlin from my blog <a href="http://www.droidmonk.com">Droidmonk</a> . Start your kotlin journey with a basic android 
activity and learn along. The project has been organized by creating a separate branch corresponding to a specific post of <a href="http://www.droidmonk.com">Droidmonk</a>.
